## Task: Stage and Commit Changes According to Guidelines

## User instructions
If the user specifies to commit only staged or specific changes, strictly listen to it.
If there is no such user instruction, ask the user for explicit consent to stage all existing changes before proceeding.

## Commit guidelines
Read and strictly follow the project's guidelines file at `.claude/instructions/commit-guidelines.md`. Do not proceed until you read this file. This is a hard requirement.
